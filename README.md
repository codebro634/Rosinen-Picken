# Rosinen-Picken
My submission for the exercise *Rosinen picken* of the 35th *Bundeswettbewerb Informatik*.

The detailed task description can be found in *Aufgabenstellung.pdf* which in sum was to devise an efficient algorithm
to find the most valuable closure in a graph. 

*Dokumentation.pdf* contains the full documentation of the solution as well as a
manual on how to operate the GUI *Rosinen_picken.jar* which makes it possible to manually run all components of the solution.
The following shows the GUI:

The jar *Rosinen_picken.jar* was compiled with Java compiler version 7 (51.0) and example graphs to run the 
algorithm on can be found in the folder *graphs*.
